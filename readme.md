# What's In The News - Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome Extension accompanying the ML solution for News Articles Classification and Summarization, *What's In The News*. Currently, it is not available in Google Chrome store and has to be manually installed.

To install this extension:

- Download it as zip
- Extract the zip file
- Open Chrome and go to *Menu* > *More Tools* > *Extensions*
- Click on *Load Unpacked*
- Select the extracted folder from above, then click *Select Folder*
- I recommend to pin the extension on the *Extensions Bar* for easy access
